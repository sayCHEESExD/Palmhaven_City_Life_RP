 *    pose captured when `player.glb` loaded (Bloxity body only);
 *  - the PROPORTIONS, as scales and offsets on those same bones.
 *
 * The body PARTS are not applied here: those replace geometry on the body
 * itself and so belong to whatever built it - see `BloxityRiderFactory`. This
 * class dresses whichever rider is currently mounted, Bloxity body or bundled

 * and fetches its catalogue from `https://api.bloxity.io`, and each route used
 * below was confirmed against the live service before it was written here.
 *
 * The important consequence: NOTHING in this file builds an asset URL out of an
 * id. The catalogue hands back an `assetPaths` object per item and those paths
 * are used verbatim - so an item Bloxity moves, renames, or stores somewhere
 * new keeps working without a change here.
